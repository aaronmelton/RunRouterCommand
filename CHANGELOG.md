## RunRouterCommand.py v1.1.10 (2013-07-20) ##
* Updating project to use Semantic Versioning: http://semver.org/
  Previous project versions were described using a MAJOR.PATCH increment
  instead of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH increment.  In other words, adjusting the
  previous version 1.10 -- it's correct Semantic Version would be 1.1.10.


## RunRouterCommand.py 1.10 (2013-07-20) ##
* Making application a bit more extendible through the use of functions and
  variables.
* Improved file error handling.

## RunRouterCommand.py 1.09 (2013-07-18) ##
* Changed application to search for 'routers.txt' file instead of 'routers.lst'
  because some users were complaining about '.lst' not being a registered file
  extension in Windows. (Their user permissions did not allow them to associate
  this extension with Notepad, etc.)
  
## RunRouterCommand.py 1.08 (2013-07-10) ##
* Updated error checking to include validating `commands.lst` file exists.

## RunRouterCommand.py 1.07 (2013-06-26) ##
* Initial "release" of application built on Exscript. This application
  is as old as my `DownloadRouterConfig.py` application, but I'm just now 
  getting around to putting it on GitHub.
