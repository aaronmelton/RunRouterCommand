RunRouterCommand.py
===================

Needs Fixing:
-------------
[ ] For loop only reads (or executes) the first command in the commands.lst
    file.  I'm a bit rusty on reading from a file so I'll study up and fix it.

New Features:
-------------
[ ] Error checking: 'commands.lst' exist?

Nice To Have:
-------------
